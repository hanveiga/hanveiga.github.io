      <p>My choice of doing a 6 months break from University has been received with some hostility, concern and doubt by a lot of people I mentioned this to. I have to admit, that sometimes I think about the choice myself, whether it is the correct one.</p>

<p>I suppose this is the first time I go &ldquo;off track&rdquo; from this &ldquo;being on-time thing&rdquo;, whatever it is. I am not even sure how to describe it, but I suppose I have always been on time or even early (because I am a December baby), for my age, regarding the things I have accomplished. Starting a masters degree at age of 20 and having worked for 3 different companies in major industry sectors was a pretty strange thing for most Swiss people. The prospect of finishing my masters when I was 22 was also pretty strange, and starting a PhD at the age of 22 would be a pretty rad thing, I suppose. I would easily pass off as a genius solely because I never deviated from my goal.</p>

<p>But what is it, this goal, even? More and more I doubt the substance of my goal, perhaps it&rsquo;s just the thing that I am expected to do, in the sense that, it all falls into place neatly. It&rsquo;s a very linear progression. Bachelors, masters, PhD, good university, good companies, yada, yada, yada. But I often get left with a sense of unfulfillment, as if most of my education were fake. I often feel like I can&rsquo;t do anything or that I am not learning at all. I am an exam passing machine that does 40 credits a semester. Look at me, I&rsquo;m so good. Except I&rsquo;m not, really. I barely passed my last set of exams and I have the feeling it was due to three facts: the realization that I was doing things that I really didn&rsquo;t like joined with the feeling that after an exam all I have is an empty mind - relieved to dump all the information I absorbed for the sole purpose of passing yet another exam, getting yet another &ldquo;trophy&rdquo;, another 8 credits, plus the sudden confirmation that life is too short for wasting time doing things you don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>So, I need to rethink my goal, my direction. What&rsquo;s the point of running full speed towards something that has yet no shape, no meaning nor purpose? My goals are these fuzzy things that I seem to approximate slowly. What I know is: I am happy I switched from studying Fluid Dynamics to Robotics because this is interesting. I am happy I am doing two courses that I really don&rsquo;t need because they are interesting. Furthermore, I know I am not happy about the prospect of doing a thesis right away in some topic I feel sorta blas√© about, and yet again, wasting 2 years of a masters for the sake of another line on my CV.</p>

<p>This should be intuitive, the idea of being happy and satisfied, but for me, it&rsquo;s like I am taking baby steps towards something that is worth spending time on and slowly trying to release my mindset from what I have set myself to do, blindly, for the sake of being nice on paper. And this is why it is absolutely clear to me that I need some time off academia and figure things in general.</p>
